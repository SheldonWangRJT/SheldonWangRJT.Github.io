After years of trying different productivity systems, I've finally settled on a combination that actually works for me. Here's my current setup and the lessons I've learned.

## The Core System

### 1. Time Blocking with Theme Days
Instead of traditional calendaring, I use theme days:
- **Monday**: Deep work (coding, analysis)
- **Tuesday**: Communications (meetings, emails)
- **Wednesday**: Learning (courses, reading)
- **Thursday**: Creation (writing, planning)
- **Friday**: Review & cleanup

This reduces decision fatigue and creates natural momentum.

### 2. The 2-2-2 Rule
- **2 hours**: Deep focus work (no phone, no interruptions)
- **2 minutes**: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
- **2 PM**: Hard cutoff for checking social media

### 3. Investment in Automation
As a tech person, I automate everything possible:
```bash
# Daily standup script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Yesterday: $(git log --oneline -1)"
echo "Today: Check calendar and prioritize top 3"
echo "Blockers: Review pending PRs and emails"
```

## Tools That Changed My Game

### Digital Tools
1. **Obsidian**: For knowledge management and daily notes
2. **Toggl**: Time tracking to understand where hours actually go
3. **Freedom**: Website/app blocker during focus hours
4. **Alfred**: Mac automation for repetitive tasks

### Physical Setup
- Standing desk with good lighting
- Noise-cancelling headphones (Sony WH-1000XM4)
- Physical notebook for brainstorming (still beats digital)
- Coffee station within arm's reach ☕

## The Anti-Productivity Insights

Sometimes being "unproductive" is the most productive thing:

### Scheduled Downtime
- **20 minutes after lunch**: Walk without phone
- **Evening routine**: No screens 1 hour before bed
- **Weekend mornings**: No agenda, just coffee and thinking

### The "Good Enough" Principle
Perfect is the enemy of done. I aim for 80% quality on most tasks, reserving perfection for what truly matters.

## What Doesn't Work (For Me)

- **Pomodoro Technique**: Too rigid, breaks my flow state
- **Complex task managers**: Spending more time organizing than doing
- **Extreme minimalism**: Some mess is okay and natural
- **Early morning routines**: I'm not a 5 AM person, and that's fine

## The Numbers Game

After tracking for 6 months:
- **Deep work**: 2-3 hours of focused work beats 8 hours of distracted work
- **Energy management**: Working with my natural rhythms increased output by 40%
- **Context switching**: Each interruption costs ~15 minutes to refocus

## Current Experiments

### 1. Energy-Based Scheduling
Instead of time-based, scheduling based on energy levels:
- High energy: Complex problem-solving
- Medium energy: Meetings and communication
- Low energy: Administrative tasks and cleanup

### 2. The "Hell Yes or No" Filter
Before committing to anything new, it has to be a "hell yes." This has dramatically reduced overcommitment.

### 3. Investment Learning Blocks
Dedicating 30 minutes daily to learning about markets, new investment strategies, or economic trends. Small consistent effort compounds.

## The Real Secret

The best productivity system is the one you'll actually use consistently. Start with one change, make it a habit, then add the next one.
