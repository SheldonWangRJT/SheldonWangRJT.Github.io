excerpt: "If you want sparkle without overpaying for a story, start with the physics: diamond is carbon, moissanite is silicon carbide, and lab-grown diamonds are diamonds. The rest is pricing, branding, and resale reality."

## TL;DR (Pick based on your goal)

| If you care most about… | Best default pick | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **“It must be a diamond” + best long-term perception** | **Natural diamond** | Same material as lab, but the market assigns it higher status and usually better resale *relative to retail*. |
| **Diamond look + best value per “diamond”** | **Lab-grown diamond** | It’s still diamond (carbon crystal). You pay less for the same physics; resale tends to be weaker. |
| **Maximum sparkle per dollar** | **Moissanite** | Very bright and “fiery,” durable for daily wear, and typically far cheaper. Not a diamond. |

## 1) Materials: what each stone *is*

### Natural diamond (mined)
- **Material**: diamond = crystalline carbon.
- **Origin**: formed naturally under high pressure/temperature, then mined, sorted, cut, and sold.

### Lab-grown diamond (CVD / HPHT)
- **Material**: also diamond = crystalline carbon.
- **Origin**: grown in controlled conditions (commonly **HPHT** = high-pressure high-temperature; **CVD** = chemical vapor deposition).
- **Important**: “lab-grown” describes **origin**, not **material**.

### Moissanite (Marquise moissanite is just a cut shape)
- **Material**: moissanite = **silicon carbide (SiC)**.
- **Origin**: natural moissanite exists but is rare; gemstones are generally **synthetic** SiC.
- **“Marquise”**: describes the *shape/cut*, like round/princess/oval—**not** a different material.

## 2) Sparkle & optics: why they look different

What people call “sparkle” is a mix of:
- **Brilliance** (white light return)
- **Fire** (colored flashes; dispersion)
- **Scintillation** (sparkle pattern as the stone moves)

### The numbers that actually matter (quick reference)

| Property | Natural diamond | Lab-grown diamond | Moissanite |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Chemical composition** | Carbon (C) | Carbon (C) | Silicon carbide (SiC) |
| **Mohs hardness (scratch resistance)** | 10 | 10 | ~9.25 |
| **Refractive index (RI)** | ~2.42 | ~2.42 | ~2.65–2.69 |
| **Dispersion (“fire”)** | ~0.044 | ~0.044 | ~0.104 |
| **Birefringence** | No (isotropic) | No (isotropic) | Yes (often visible as “double refraction”) |

**Sources** (starting points with citations you can follow):
- Diamond: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond`
- Lab-grown diamond: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_diamond`
- Moissanite: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite`

### Diamond vs. moissanite: the “fire” giveaway
- Moissanite is famous for looking **more “rainbow-y”** under many lighting conditions.
- Diamond tends to look **more white/neutral** in its sparkle (still has fire, but typically less “disco ball” than moissanite).

### Natural diamond vs. lab diamond: optics are the same category
- Because both are diamond, their optical behavior is fundamentally the same.
- Differences you may see in real life usually come from **cut quality** and **clarity** (and sometimes growth-related features detectable by labs), not “lab vs mined” as a visual category.

---

## 3) Durability: daily wear reality

For rings, durability is not just hardness; it’s also how a stone handles impact, edges, and long-term abrasion.

- **Diamond (natural or lab)**: top-tier hardness (Mohs 10 → extremely scratch resistant).  
- **Moissanite**: also very hard (~Mohs 9.25) and commonly used for daily wear; it’s not as hard as diamond, but it’s still far above most gemstones.

Practical takeaway:
- If you’re rough on jewelry or you want a forever ring, **both diamond and moissanite are viable**—but diamond is the “benchmark.”

---

## 4) Price: what you’re actually paying for

### Natural diamond pricing
You pay for:
- the stone’s **4Cs** (cut, color, clarity, carat),
- branding/retail margin,
- and a long-established market perception that “natural” is premium.

### Lab-grown diamond pricing
You usually pay less because:
- supply can scale (factories can make more),
- and market prices have been trending downward as production expands and competition increases.

### Moissanite pricing
You usually pay far less because:
- it’s not a diamond,
- and the market positions it as a value alternative.

Practical takeaway:
- If your goal is “most diamond per dollar,” lab-grown usually wins.
- If your goal is “most sparkle per dollar,” moissanite often wins.

## 5) Resale: the part most people don’t want to talk about

This is where expectations get wrecked.

### Natural diamond resale (the “dog water” reality—explained carefully)
- In many consumer scenarios, **retail diamonds resell for far less than retail**.
- Why? Retail includes marketing, storefront overhead, and margin. Resale buyers pay closer to **wholesale/secondary-market** economics.
- Some stones hold value better than others (excellent cut, desirable size ranges, strong certs), but **“I’ll get my money back” is not a safe assumption**.

### Lab-grown diamond resale
- Often weaker resale than natural because supply is expandable and retail prices have been falling.
- That doesn’t make lab diamonds “bad”—it just means you should buy them for **wearing**, not as an investment.

### Moissanite resale
- Typically limited resale market and low recovery relative to what you paid.
- Again: buy it for enjoyment and value, not resale.

## 6) The diamond supply chain (and why people call it “scammy”)

Let’s separate two ideas:
- **Diamonds as a material**: legitimately rare in “large, clean, gem-quality” form, extremely useful industrially, and beautiful when cut well.
- **Diamonds as a consumer product**: historically shaped by marketing, controlled distribution, and cultural pressure.

### A simplified chain
1) **Mining / sourcing** (or lab growth)  
2) **Sorting & valuation** (rough grading)  
3) **Cutting & polishing** (where a lot of “beauty” is created)  
4) **Certification** (independent labs issue grading reports)  
5) **Wholesale distribution**  
6) **Retail** (brands, markups, financing)  
7) **Secondary market** (where prices behave very differently than retail)

### “Diamonds aren’t rare” vs “gem diamonds are rare”
Both can be true depending on what someone means:
- Diamond (as a material) is widely present in the Earth.
- **Gem-quality** diamonds (size + clarity + color + cut potential) are a smaller subset.

### The “monopoly / manufactured scarcity” critique
Historically, the diamond market’s pricing and social meaning were heavily influenced by large players, stockpiles, and marketing that linked diamonds to romance and status—most famously the **“A Diamond is Forever”** messaging associated with De Beers-era marketing history.

If you want to read the marketing history overview, start here:
- De Beers background (includes market control/marketing sections): `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers`
- “A Diamond Is Forever” campaign background: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Diamond_Is_Forever`

*(These are not “primary sources,” but they’re a reasonable jump-off point and include citations you can follow.)*

## 7) How to buy smart (and avoid regrets)

- **Decide your priority**: “must be natural,” “must be diamond,” or “best value sparkle.”
- **Overweight cut quality**: cut drives beauty more than most people realize.
- **Don’t buy for resale**: assume resale is poor and be pleasantly surprised if it isn’t.
- **Get documentation**:
  - Natural diamonds often come with a grading report from major labs.
  - Lab-grown diamonds should be **clearly disclosed** as lab-grown and should have a report from a reputable lab used in that segment.
- **Compare stones in the lighting you live in**: moissanite especially can look different under different light sources.
