## 🔐 Security Notes

### **What's Secure:**
- ✅ Content is encrypted with AES-256
- ✅ Can't read by viewing page source
- ✅ Can't access without correct password
- ✅ Password is never stored unencrypted

### **What's NOT Secure:**
- ⚠️ Anyone with password can decrypt
- ⚠️ Password is client-side (shared secret)
- ⚠️ No logging of who accessed it
- ⚠️ Not suitable for highly sensitive data (use Netlify for that)

### **Good For:**
- ✅ Interview prep materials
- ✅ Sharing with specific people
- ✅ Content you want to control access to
- ✅ Growing your professional reputation

## 🚀 Going Live

When you're ready to publish:

1. Test locally thoroughly
2. Make sure password is secure
3. Commit all files
4. Push to GitHub
5. Share password with people you want to help
6. Monitor via Google Analytics (if enabled)
