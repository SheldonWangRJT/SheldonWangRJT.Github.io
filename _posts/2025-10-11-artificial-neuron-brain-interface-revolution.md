        self.threshold = threshold_voltage
        self.protein_nanowires = self.initialize_nanowires()
        
    def receive_input(self, synaptic_input):
        """Receive ionic signals through protein nanowires"""
        # Ionic conductance through protein channels
        self.membrane_potential += synaptic_input
        
    def check_firing(self):
        """Determine if neuron should fire action potential"""
        if self.membrane_potential >= self.threshold:
            return self.fire_action_potential()
        return False
        
    def fire_action_potential(self):
        """Generate spike using bio-ionic mechanisms"""
        # Mimics sodium/potassium ion exchange
        spike_voltage = +40  # mV
        self.membrane_potential = spike_voltage
        
        # Reset after firing
        self.reset_potential()
        return True
        
    def reset_potential(self):
        """Return to resting state"""
