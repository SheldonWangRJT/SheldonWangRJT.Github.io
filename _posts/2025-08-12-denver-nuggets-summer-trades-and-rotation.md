The Mile High front office went to work this summer — and Nuggets Nation got a show. Let’s break down the biggest moves, how the new pieces fit around the best player on earth (yes, Nikola Jokić 😌🐐), the bench depth, a realistic regular-season rotation, that spicy Christmas clash vs. the Wolves 🎄🐺, and where Vegas puts Denver’s title chances. Buckle up! ✈️⛰️

## Key Moves, With Receipts 📑

- **Michael Porter Jr. ➡️ Cam Johnson** (reported): Nuggets sent MPJ and a future first to the Nets for Cam Johnson — a two-way forward coming off a career year (18.8 PTS, 4.3 REB, 3.4 AST). Sources: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sports/reports-nuggets-sending-michael-porter-jr-nets-cam-johnson-2025-07-01/).
- **Added: Jonas Valančiūnas** (backup 5): Veteran glass-eater behind Jokić to stabilize non-Jokić minutes. Sources: [Axios Denver](https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2025/07/17/denver-nuggets-summer-signings-roster-overhaul).
- **Signed: Tim Hardaway Jr.** (bench scoring): One-year deal; 36.8% from three last season. Source: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sports/reports-tim-hardaway-jr-reaches-deal-with-nuggets-2025-07-01/).
- **Welcome back: Bruce Brown** (versatility king): Swiss-army guard/wing returns on a one-year deal to re-ignite 2023 title DNA. Source: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/sports/reports-nuggets-sending-michael-porter-jr-nets-cam-johnson-2025-07-01/).

## Why This Works Around Jokić 🧠🎯

- **Cam Johnson spacing + defense**: High-IQ cutter and 40% catch-and-shoot threat opens the elbows for Jokić’s handoff game. Defensively, he sizes up vs. rangy wings the West keeps throwing at Denver.
- **Valančiūnas as a true backup 5**: You’re buying sturdy screening, DREB%, put-backs, and a legit post outlet vs. bench units — all without asking him to mimic Jokić-ball.
- **Bruce Brown’s chaos factor**: Point-of-attack defense, short-roll decision-making, and guard screening chemistry with Jokić were key in 2023. That synergy matters in playoff half-court rock fights.
- **THJ microwave minutes**: Second-unit drought buster. Run him off staggers and Spain PnR with Jokić as the hub. If he hits a heater, you steal quarters. 🔥

## Core Numbers To Know (last season) 📊

- **Nikola Jokić**: All-world engine. Full card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jokicni01.html). On/Off data consistently shows Denver’s offense transforms with him on — duh — but the bench gap was the issue.
- **Jamal Murray**: Shot creation valve. Card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/murraya01.html).
- **Cam Johnson**: Efficiency + spacing profile fits like a glove. Card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsca02.html).
- **Aaron Gordon**: The glue. Screens, cuts, and toughest wing/forward cover most nights. Card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/gordoaa01.html).
- **Jonas Valančiūnas**: Rebounding/paint presence. Card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/valanjo01.html).
- **Tim Hardaway Jr.**: High-volume off-movement shooter. Card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardati02.html).
- **Bruce Brown**: Versatile lineup lubricant. Card: [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/brownbr01.html).

## What The Trades Change — Tactics + Data 🔎

- **Cam Johnson vs. MPJ profile**
  - Johnson brings more reliable POA/wing defense and quick-trigger catch-and-shoots (see 3PA rate and corner 3 share on his [BBR Shooting](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsca02.html#shooting) tab). In DHO actions with Jokić, quicker releases force top-locks and open back-cuts — perfect for Gordon’s dunker-spot seams.
  - MPJ was elite at difficult shot-making and high release over contests. Swapping for Johnson tilts shot diet toward “cleaner looks” and improves defensive scheme versatility (switch/peel/help). Outcome: higher lineup floor, slightly lower usage volatility.

- **Non-Jokić minutes stabilization (Valančiūnas)**
  - Bench stretches cratered when Jokić sat. A traditional 5 with elite defensive rebounding rate and foul-drawing keeps second units out of transition-defense nightmares. Check Valančiūnas’ TRB%/DRB% on his [Advanced](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/v/valanjo01.html#all_advanced) card.
  - Offensively: more second-chance points and set offense; defensively: more single-possession trips. That stabilizes game flow on the road and on back-to-backs.

- **Bench creation + spacing (THJ + Brown)**
  - THJ’s gravity as a movement shooter widens gaps for Brown short-roll reads. Brown’s history in Denver screening for guards can revive a second-unit identity: defend, run, shoot, repeat. Usage: stagger Murray/Johnson to ensure one primary creator on floor at all times.

- **Lineup fit around Jokić**
  - With Johnson/Gordon flanking, you can play “5-out” principles (weakside 45 cuts, Spain PnR, Chicago action) without sacrificing size. Expect better corner-3 volume and fewer late-clock ISOs.

What it shows (high-level, all verifiable on BBR):

- Sustained elite box-creation: top-tier in **BPM** and **VORP** each year; massive **WS/48** and **On-Off** impact.
- Counting lines that bend defenses every night: points + rebounds + assists stacks that routinely flirt with triple-double baselines; steals rates hold up given usage.
- Translation to playoffs: half-court efficiency and shot quality don’t fall off a cliff — the rare heliocentric hub who improves decision quality under pressure.

If you track modern all-in-ones like **LEBRON** (BBall Index) or **EPM** (DunksAndThrees), Jokić grades out in the very top band annually. Those dashboards are subscription sites, but they corroborate what BBR’s public metrics show.

## Bench Depth Check ✅

- Second unit identity: **defend, run, and shoot**. Brown at the point-of-attack, THJ sprinting the lanes, Valančiūnas cleaning the glass, plus one of Murray/Johnson staggering to keep shot creation afloat. KYP = Keep Your Pace.
- Stagger philosophy: Always keep one of Jokić/Murray on the floor. When it’s a no-Jokić stretch, feature THJ/Johnson movement sets and Brown as the connective passer.

## Regular-Season Rotation (October blueprint) 🗺️

- Starters: **Jokić – Gordon – Cam Johnson – Murray – KCP**
- Second unit core: **Valančiūnas – THJ – Bruce Brown – Christian Braun**
- Staggers: Johnson or Murray toggles into the bench group; KCP’s minutes tilt toward closing integrity.
- Closers (matchup-dependent): **Jokić / Murray / Gordon** + two of **KCP, Johnson, Brown, THJ, Braun**. If you need stops: Brown/KCP. If you need flamethrowers: THJ/Johnson. 🔥🔒

## The Christmas Clash vs. Wolves 🎄🐺

Denver–Minnesota has become a heavyweight Christmas tradition — physical, chippy, and playoff-flavored. Expect Jokić vs. Gobert geometry, Ant vs. Gordon/KCP battles, and lots of half-court problem-solving.

## Final Take 🏔️

Jokić is still the sun everything orbits. Denver added size behind him (Valančiūnas), defense/spacing on the wing (Cam Johnson), and bench scoring/versatility (THJ, Bruce Brown). The formula is simple: keep one star on, defend with juice, and let The Maestro conduct. If health holds, the Nuggets are absolutely in the ring — cowboy hat on, lasso ready. 🤠🏆
