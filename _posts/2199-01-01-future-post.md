Post writing prompt:

1. use the blogs in the __posts folder to create an ios tech blog post for me
2. post have not to be duplicate with existing top
3. you dont have to mention but my context is that i'm an staff ios engineer that has 10+ years exp and worked in apps that serves billions users
4. the post can be related to any Apple, iOS SDK or even product release info of the timing of the month you chose to add to (you can chose a date within past 3 years)
5. the content is better to be rich with coding examples for the most of the time but not always be true if it is more towards a system design type of post
6. you can use emoji, hyper links screenshots, quoted source etc to make post richer and more consumable
