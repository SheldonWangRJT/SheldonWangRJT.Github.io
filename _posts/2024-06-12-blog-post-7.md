In WWDC 2024's [Swift 6 Migration](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10169/), Ben from Apple's Swift team mentioned that there is a big difference for the global variable between Objective-C and Swift.

If you want to guess now, which one will be in the risk of a data race? And which one is thread-safe?

## Anwser 

Objective-C global variable is not thread-safe and it's prune to data race.
Swift global variable is thread-safe but it's prune to data race.

## Why?

TL;DR Swift global variable is lazily created, and it's created upon the first caller, which means it's vulnerable to multi-threading access and data race.

To be exact:

### Objective-C Global Variables

#### Creation Time
- **Static Initialization**: In Objective-C, global variables are typically initialized at program startup, before the `main` function is executed. This is known as static initialization.
- **Compile Time**: The compiler allocates memory for global variables, and their initialization occurs as the binary is loaded into memory by the runtime.

#### Data Race Risk
- **Data Race Risk**: Objective-C global variables can be prone to data races because they are not inherently thread-safe. If multiple threads attempt to read and write to a global variable simultaneously, it can lead to inconsistent or incorrect states. 
- **Synchronization Required**: To prevent data races, explicit synchronization mechanisms like locks or GCD (Grand Central Dispatch) are needed when accessing global variables across multiple threads. 

### Swift Global Variables

#### Creation Time
- **Lazy Initialization**: In Swift, global variables are lazily initialized. This means that the global variable is not created until it is first accessed. This is managed by a dispatch_once-like mechanism internally, ensuring the variable is initialized only once.
- **Deferred Initialization**: This lazy initialization helps in reducing the initial memory footprint and avoids unnecessary initialization if the global variable is never used.

#### Data Race Risk
- **Thread-Safety with Lazy Initialization**: Swift's lazy initialization of global variables is thread-safe. The runtime ensures that even if multiple threads attempt to access the global variable simultaneously, the variable will be initialized only once.
- **Data Race Risk Reduced**: Although the initialization process is thread-safe, the use of global variables in Swift can still lead to data races if the variable is mutable and accessed concurrently without proper synchronization.
- **Synchronization Needed for Mutable Variables**: For mutable global variables, developers must ensure thread-safe access by using synchronization mechanisms such as dispatch queues or locks to avoid data races.

### Example Comparison

#### Objective-C
```objective-c
// Objective-C global variable
int globalVariable = 0;

// Function to increment the global variable
void incrementGlobalVariable() {
    globalVariable++;
}
```

#### Swift
```swift
// Swift global variable
var globalVariable: Int = 0

// Function to increment the global variable
func incrementGlobalVariable() {
    globalVariable += 1
}
```

In both cases, if incrementGlobalVariable is called from multiple threads simultaneously, there is a risk of a data race. However, in Swift, the initial creation of globalVariable is thread-safe due to its lazy initialization, while in Objective-C, this is not a consideration since the variable is initialized at program startup.

### Summary

- **Creation Time**:
  - **Objective-C**: Global variables are initialized at program startup.
  - **Swift**: Global variables are lazily initialized upon first access, ensuring thread-safe initialization.
  
- **Data Race Risk**:
  - **Objective-C**: Global variables can lead to data races if accessed concurrently without synchronization.
  - **Swift**: While the lazy initialization is thread-safe, mutable global variables still require explicit synchronization to avoid data races during concurrent access.

### Fix Swift 6 Concurrency Warning

If all the callers are from main thread / main actor, we can add annotation
```swift
// Swift global variable
@MainActor var globalVariable: Int = 0
```

**[last resort]** We can also let consumer be cautious by adding 
```swift 
// Swift global variable
nonisolated(unsafe) var globalVariable: Int = 0
```
