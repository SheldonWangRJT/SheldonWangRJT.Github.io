## 🌟 Why Work With Me?

### **Technical Excellence**
I don't just write code – I architect systems that scale. From managing 4 billion monthly video views to refactoring 200K+ lines of production code, I've proven I can handle complexity at any scale.

### **Leadership That Delivers**
Leading 10-person teams across 30+ partner teams taught me that great code alone isn't enough. Communication, planning, and bringing people together around a shared vision – that's where impact happens.

### **Impact-Driven Mindset**
Every line of code should solve a real problem. Whether it's cutting latency by 60% or building features for 100M daily users, I focus on measurable outcomes that matter to users and business.

### **Continuous Learning**
Tech moves fast. I stay ahead by constantly learning – evident from this blog with 41K+ words written this month alone on AI, fusion energy, market analysis, and more. I bring that curiosity to every project.
