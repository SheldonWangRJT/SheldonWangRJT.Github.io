Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🌐 I'm Sheldon – Staff iOS Engineer at Meta, former Snapchat architect, and your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast who believes life's too short for boring code and bad coffee. ☕️

## 🗺️ What You'll Find Here

### 📔 [**Tech Blog Posts**](/year-archive/) 
Deep dives into iOS development, system design, and the art of building apps that millions love. From Swift concurrency patterns to performance optimization tips that actually work. Perfect for when you want to level up your mobile game!

### 💸 [**Investment & Finance**](/portfolio/) 
My thoughts on markets, money, and making sense of the economic chaos around us. Expect data-driven analysis mixed with just enough skepticism to keep things interesting. Warning: may contain unpopular opinions about crypto. 😏

### 🎮 [**Life & Interests**](/life/)
The fun stuff! Productivity hacks that don't suck, life experiments worth trying, and whatever random rabbit holes I've fallen down lately. Think of it as the place where professional meets personal (and occasionally weird).

### 🛝 [**Playground**](/playground/)
Interactive demos and experiments – because sometimes you need to see code in action rather than just read about it. Come here when you want to break things in a safe environment.

### 🏷️ [**Browse Posts by Tags**](/tags/)
Explore all content organized by topics and themes. Perfect for finding posts on specific subjects like iOS development, finance strategies, or productivity tips.

## 🎯 Who Am I?

**In the professional world:** I build mobile experiences that reach hundreds of millions of users. At Meta, I work on Facebook's ads and AI systems. Before that, I was deep in Snapchat's iOS codebase (fun fact: I'm a top-20 all-time committer there 🏆).

**In the real world:** I'm the guy who gets genuinely excited about elegant code architecture, spends too much time optimizing workflows, and thinks the best conversations happen over good food and bad puns.

**My superpower:** Taking complex technical concepts and making them actually understandable. Whether that's explaining iOS memory management or why your portfolio allocation might be all wrong.

## 🚀 Latest & Greatest

Recently shipped: Evidence-based guide to slowing hair graying (because apparently stress *does* cause gray hair, and I have the papers to prove it), deep dives into Swift concurrency patterns, and some questionable takes on market dynamics.
