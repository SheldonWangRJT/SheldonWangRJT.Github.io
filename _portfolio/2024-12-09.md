## 🌟 Strategic Spending Guide: Maximize Your Rewards! 

> 🚨 **CRITICAL WARNING: DANGER ZONE** 🚨
> 
> 💡 **Pro Tip**: These cashback calculations ONLY make financial sense if you:
> - **PAY YOUR FULL BALANCE EVERY MONTH**
> - **AVOID ALL INTEREST CHARGES**
> 
> 🔴 **IF YOU CARRY A BALANCE, INTEREST WILL OBLITERATE ANY CASHBACK BENEFITS**
> 
> Example: 
> - 5% Cashback = $5 earned
> - 20% Annual Interest Rate = $20+ in interest
> - **YOU LOSE MONEY**
> 
> 💸 **NEVER SPEND MONEY YOU CAN'T IMMEDIATELY PAY OFF**
