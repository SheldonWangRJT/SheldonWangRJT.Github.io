How much money you can lose if you buy a 70k car now. We can do a simple math.

## Make the purchase

First let's calculate what will happen if we made the purchase.

### Fees before car is out of door

Assuming dealer has some fees around 1k, and sales tax 8% = 5.6k, some additional fees like warranty, window tint etc 2k. The total cost is 70k + 1k + 5.6k + 2k = 78.6k

### Assuming 10k downpayment, 8% APR interest rate, 60 month payments

8% interest rate for 60-month car payments

$$ P = $68,600 $$

$$ r = \frac{0.08}{12} $$

$$ n = 72 $$

Now, let's calculate the monthly payment:

$$ r = \frac{0.08}{12} = 0.006666... $$

$$ M = 68600 \times \frac{0.006666... \times (1 + 0.006666...)^{72}}{(1 + 0.006666...)^{72} - 1} $$

$$ M = 68600 \times \frac{0.006666... \times (1.006666...)^{72}}{(1.006666...)^{72} - 1} $$

$$ M ≈ 68600 \times \frac{0.006666... \times 1.776129}{1.776129 - 1} $$

$$ M ≈ 68600 \times \frac{0.011840}{0.776129} $$

$$ M ≈ 68600 \times 0.015234 $$

$$ M ≈ 1044.95 $$


So, with no down payment, the approximate monthly payment for a $68,600 car with an 8% APR over a 6-year term would be approximately $1,044.95, totaling $75,417.60 acoss the 6 years. With 10k downpayment, we spent $85,417.60 so far.

### National average car depreciation rate 

The depreciation of a car over time can vary based on factors like make, model, condition, and mileage. However, as an approximation, the national average depreciation rate for a car after 6 years is estimated to be around 50-60% of its original value.

Let's take the midpoint of this range for our calculation, assuming a depreciation rate of 55%.

If the car's original price is $70,000, after 6 years, its depreciated value would be:


$$ Depreciated\,Value = Original\,Price \times (1 - Depreciation\,Rate) $$

$$ Depreciated\,Value = $70,000 \times (1 - 0.55) $$

$$ Depreciated\,Value = $70,000 \times 0.45 $$

$$ Depreciated\,Value = $31,500 $$

### Losing 

Now we can know the total lost value is:

$$ Total\,Lost\,Value = $85,417.60 - 31,500 $$

$$ Total\,Lost\,Value = $54,417.60 $$

## What if we invest instead?

### Calculation:

1. Future Value of Initial Investment:
$$ FV_{\text{initial}} = 10,000 \times (1 + \frac{0.08}{12})^{72} $$ 

$$ FV_{\text{initial}} ≈ 10,000 \times (1.00667)^{72} ≈ 10,000 \times 1.717 $$ 

$$ FV_{\text{initial}} ≈ 17,170 $$ 

2. Future Value of Monthly Investments:
$$ FV_{\text{annuity}} = 1044.95 \times \frac{(1 + \frac{0.08}{12})^{72} - 1}{\frac{0.08}{12}} $$ 

$$ FV_{\text{annuity}} ≈ 1044.95 \times \frac{(1.00667)^{72} - 1}{0.00667} ≈ 1044.95 \times 94.506 $$ 

$$ FV_{\text{annuity}} ≈ 98,978.16 $$ 

3. Total Future Value:
$$ FV_{\text{total}} = FV_{\text{initial}} + FV_{\text{annuity}} $$ 

$$ FV_{\text{total}} ≈ 17,170 + 98,978.16 $$ 

$$ FV_{\text{total}} ≈ 116,148.16 $$ 

So, the total future value is approximately $116,148.16.

### Profit

The profit is $46,148.16.

## The difference (true losing)

On a given car with 70k price tag, we are looking at 

$$ Difference = $116.1k - 31.5k $$

$$ Difference = $84.6k $$

In other words, we are losing 84.6k truely taking the opportunity cost into consideratio, that is -120% in investment return rate. Please consider sharing to make the people around you making better financial decisions!
