I've been tracking my personal stock portfolio performance against the S&P 500 benchmark for the past few weeks. With my portfolio heavily allocated to technology stocks, recent market conditions have been challenging. Here's a detailed comparison and analysis of how my investment strategy is performing relative to the broader market.

### **Overall Performance (August 15-29, 2025)**
- **My Portfolio**: -3.09% total return
- **S&P 500**: -0.09% total return
- **Excess Return**: -3.00% underperformance

### **Risk-Adjusted Performance**
- **My Portfolio Volatility**: 1.12% daily average
- **S&P 500 Volatility**: 0.67% daily average
- **Sharpe Ratio (My Portfolio)**: -2.76
- **Sharpe Ratio (S&P 500)**: -0.13

## Portfolio Composition Analysis

### **Current Allocation**

Based on my actual portfolio holdings, here's the detailed breakdown:

| Holding | Allocation | Category | Performance Driver |
|---------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **NVDA** | 27.72% | Technology (AI/GPU) | AI chip demand, gaming |
| **NFLX** | 16.28% | Technology (Streaming) | Subscriber growth, content |
| **MSFT** | 12.31% | Technology (Software) | Cloud services, AI integration |
| **FTEC** | 11.02% | Technology ETF | Broad tech sector exposure |
| **QQQM** | 10.26% | Technology ETF (Nasdaq) | Growth tech companies |
| **FDVV** | 8.91% | Dividend ETF | Value/dividend stocks |
| **VOO** | 7.19% | S&P 500 ETF | Broad market exposure |
| **META** | 1.66% | Technology (Social Media) | Digital advertising, AI |
| **IBIT** | 4.59% | Bitcoin ETF | Cryptocurrency exposure |

### **Key Portfolio Characteristics**

- **Technology Concentration**: ~83% in tech-related holdings
- **Single Stock Risk**: NVDA at 27.72% represents significant concentration risk
- **ETF Diversification**: 37% in ETFs provides some sector diversification
- **Growth vs Value**: Heavy tilt toward growth stocks with only FDVV providing dividend exposure

### **Why This Allocation Struggled Recently**

This allocation has performed well for most of the year, but the recent tech sector volatility has caused underperformance during these specific two volatile weeks due to:

- **NVDA's AI bubble concerns** (27.72% position amplified losses)
- **Tech sector rotation** from growth to value stocks
- **Rising interest rates** affecting high-multiple tech valuations
- **Regulatory concerns** around big tech companies
- **Market correlation** - when tech sells off, most holdings move together

The S&P 500's broad diversification across sectors provided stability during this period of tech sector weakness.

## Why I'm Underperforming the S&P 500

### **1. Tech Sector Concentration Risk**
My portfolio is heavily concentrated in technology stocks (83% tech exposure), which have been under pressure due to:
- **NVDA's AI bubble concerns** (27.72% position amplified losses)
- Rising interest rates affecting growth stock valuations
- Regulatory concerns around big tech
- Rotation from growth to value stocks
- Market concerns about AI bubble

### **2. High Volatility Exposure**
The technology sector has experienced higher volatility than the broader market, leading to:
- Larger daily swings in portfolio value
- Increased drawdowns during market corrections
- Higher correlation between holdings during tech selloffs

### **3. Market Timing Challenges**
Recent market conditions have been unfavorable for growth stocks:
- Value stocks outperforming growth stocks
- Defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) showing strength
- Technology sector facing headwinds from multiple factors

### **4. Concentration vs Diversification**
While the S&P 500 benefits from broad diversification across sectors, my concentrated approach has:
- Amplified losses during tech sector weakness
- Reduced exposure to outperforming sectors (energy, utilities)
- Increased correlation risk among holdings

## üéì Lessons Learned

### **‚ùå What's Not Working**
- **Over-concentration in tech**: 83% tech allocation has amplified losses during sector weakness
- **NVDA concentration risk**: 27.72% position in NVDA magnified AI bubble concerns
- **Timing the market**: Attempting to catch tech rebounds has led to further losses
- **Ignoring diversification**: Lack of exposure to outperforming sectors (energy, utilities, consumer staples)

### **‚úÖ What I'm Learning**
- **Sector concentration risk**: Even quality companies can underperform when their sector faces headwinds
- **Importance of diversification**: The S&P 500's broad diversification provides stability during sector rotations
- **Patience during drawdowns**: Tech stocks may take time to recover from valuation compression

### **üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management Insights**
- **Position sizing**: Individual positions of 15-20% can create significant portfolio volatility
- **Correlation risk**: High correlation between tech holdings amplifies losses during sector weakness
- **Stop-loss discipline**: Need to maintain strict stop-losses to limit downside

## üöÄ Forward-Looking Strategy

### **‚è∞ Short Term (Next 30 Days)**
- **Reduce tech concentration**: Gradually reduce technology allocation to improve diversification
- **Add defensive positions**: Consider adding utilities (XLU) or consumer staples (XLP) ETFs
- **Monitor earnings**: Be prepared to adjust positions based on Q3 earnings reports
- **Set stop-losses**: Implement 7-10% stop-losses on all tech positions

### **üìÖ Medium Term (3-6 Months)**
- **Rebalancing plan**: Target more balanced allocation across sectors
- **Sector diversification**: Add exposure to energy (XLE) and utilities (XLU) sectors
- **Value exposure**: Consider adding value ETFs (VTV) to balance growth exposure
- **International diversification**: Add developed market ETFs (EFA) for geographic diversification

### **üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management**
- **Position sizing limits**: Reduce individual stock positions to maximum 10% of portfolio (currently NVDA at 27.72%)
- **Sector limits**: Cap any single sector at 40% of portfolio (currently tech at 83%)
- **Regular rebalancing**: Weekly monitoring, monthly rebalancing
- **Stop-loss strategy**: 7% stop-loss on individual stocks, 15% on sector ETFs

## üìà Benchmark Comparison Insights

### **üìâ When I Underperform**
- **Tech sector weakness**: Heavy tech allocation amplifies losses during sector selloffs
- **Growth to value rotation**: Lack of value exposure hurts performance during style rotations
- **Rising interest rates**: Growth stocks typically underperform when rates increase
- **Market volatility**: Higher volatility in tech stocks leads to larger drawdowns

### **üìà When I Outperform**
- **Tech sector strength**: Concentrated tech positions capture upside during sector rallies
- **Earnings beats**: Individual stock selection can outperform during strong earnings seasons
- **Growth momentum**: Tech stocks typically lead during growth-oriented market environments

## üéØ Conclusion

My portfolio has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over this tracking period, primarily due to:
1. **Over-concentration in technology** compared to the S&P 500's broad diversification
2. **Sector rotation headwinds** affecting growth stocks
3. **Higher volatility** from concentrated positions
4. **Lack of diversification** into outperforming sectors

This underperformance highlights the importance of:
- **üîÑ Sector diversification** to reduce concentration risk
- **‚öñÔ∏è Balanced allocation** between growth and value
- **üõ°Ô∏è Risk management** through position sizing and stop-losses
- **‚è≥ Patience** during sector-specific drawdowns

The key lesson is that even quality companies can underperform when their sector faces headwinds. A more balanced approach with proper diversification would likely provide better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
