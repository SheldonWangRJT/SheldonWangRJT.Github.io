# Freshness Policy

Use this policy when authoring or updating content that can become outdated.

## Trigger Conditions (Run Real-Time Checks)

Run web/source verification when the post contains:

- "latest", "current", "new in 20xx", roadmap, launch status
- pricing, subscription tiers, plan comparisons
- release/version claims (Xcode, Swift, iOS, tools, APIs)
- market data, macro outlook, rate/policy expectations
- legal/regulatory or tax guidance references
- competitive "best tool/platform" claims

## Verification Standard

1. Prefer primary sources first:
   - official docs/release notes/changelogs
   - company engineering/product announcements
   - standards/regulator publications
2. Use at least 2 independent sources for high-impact factual claims.
3. If sources conflict:
   - state uncertainty
   - avoid hard conclusions
   - provide date context

## Writing Rules for Fresh Facts

- Add `Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD` for sections with volatile facts.
- Link sources inline near each critical claim.
- Avoid exact numbers if verification is weak; use directional language.
- Do not present rumors as facts.

## When Not to Search

You can skip real-time checks for:

- timeless architecture principles
- personal experience/opinion posts without factual claims
- purely local code examples with no external dependency claims
