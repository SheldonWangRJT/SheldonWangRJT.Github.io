# Backend Post Standards

Apply when topic is backend/API/distributed systems/database/devops.

1. Reader value must be implementation-first:
   - architecture diagram explanation, endpoint/data model examples, and operational tradeoffs.
   - perspective should reflect staff+ engineering decision-making.
2. Include concrete backend artifacts when relevant:
   - schema snippets, API contract examples, queue/retry behavior, caching strategy, failure modes.
   - for non-trivial systems, include at least one architecture/sequence/state diagram.
3. Mention reliability and operations:
   - observability, error handling, rollout plan, and performance constraints.
4. Keep claims practical:
   - avoid vague "best practice" language without context and caveats.
5. Code amount guidance:
   - code snippets are optional; diagrams and interface contracts can be primary artifacts.
