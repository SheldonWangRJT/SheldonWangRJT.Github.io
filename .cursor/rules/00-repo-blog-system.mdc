# Repo Blog System (Always Apply)

This repository has a dedicated blog workflow. For any request related to writing, editing, reviewing, or publishing content, follow these rules:

1. Treat this repository's blog standard as authoritative:
   - Read `.cursor/guidance/blog-publishing-guide.md` before creating or modifying blog content.
2. Use the project skill:
   - Read `.cursor/skills/blog-authoring/SKILL.md` and follow its workflow/checklists.
   - If topic is backend/system/api/infrastructure focused, also use `.cursor/skills/backend-blog-authoring/SKILL.md`.
   - If topic is AI/LLM/agent/model/tooling focused, also use `.cursor/skills/ai-blog-authoring/SKILL.md`.
3. Keep guidance repo-local:
   - Prefer `.cursor/guidance/*` and `.cursor/skills/*` in this repo, not user-global guidance.
4. Enforce collection correctness:
   - Tech posts go to `_posts/`
   - Use the correct folder for non-tech content as defined in the publishing guide.
5. Enforce date and filename validity:
   - Filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
   - Date must not be in the future unless explicitly requested.
6. Enforce quality:
   - Include concrete value for readers (examples, practical steps, checklists, and implementation-level detail).
7. Respect navigation tab mapping:
   - `📔 Tech Blog Posts` (`/year-archive/`) -> `_posts/`
   - `💸 Investment & Finance` (`/portfolio/`) -> `_portfolio/`
   - `🎮 Life & Interests` (`/life/`) -> `_life/`
   - `👟 Collections` (`/collections/`) -> `_collections/`
   - `🛝 Playground` (`/playground/`) -> `_playground/`
   - `🎯 iOS Interviews` (`/ios-interviews/`) -> `_interviews/` + related page wiring
8. Enforce freshness for time-sensitive content:
   - For volatile claims (pricing, releases, market/policy data, "latest/current"), run real-time verification and include source links or "Last verified" notes.
9. Enforce seniority perspective:
   - Write from a staff+ engineer angle: decision quality, tradeoffs, constraints, operations, and long-term maintainability.
