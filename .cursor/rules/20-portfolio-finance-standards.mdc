# Portfolio Content Standards

For `_portfolio` content:

1. Front matter baseline:
   - `title`, `description`, `date`, `permalink`, `tags`
2. URL/permalink:
   - Must use `/portfolio/.../`
3. Content quality:
   - Include scenario analysis, assumptions, and risk caveats.
   - Prefer tables/checklists for allocation and action plans.
4. Safety:
   - Include a non-advisory disclaimer for market/investment strategy content.
