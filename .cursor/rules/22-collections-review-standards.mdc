# Collections Standards

For `_collections` content:

1. Follow sneaker/product review format:
   - Overview, design, comfort/fit, value assessment, final verdict.
2. Front matter baseline:
   - `title`, `description`, `date`, `permalink`, `tags`
3. URL/permalink:
   - Must use `/collections/.../`
4. Reader value:
   - Include specification table and explicit pros/cons.
