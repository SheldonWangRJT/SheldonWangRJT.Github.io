# iOS Interviews Standards

For `_interviews` content:

1. Keep this section access-controlled and reputation-focused.
2. Do not expose or rotate real passwords in public guidance content.
3. If workflow changes affect encryption or access:
   - Validate `_interviews/encrypt.js` update flow still works.
   - Verify `/ios-interviews/` page wiring remains consistent.
4. Keep content structured for interview prep:
   - clear problem, tradeoffs, and solution breakdowns.
