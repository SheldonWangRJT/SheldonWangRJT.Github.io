# _posts Standards

When editing files in `_posts/**/*.md`, enforce:

1. Required front matter keys:
   - `layout`, `title`, `description`, `date`, `categories`, `tags`, `excerpt`
2. Date format:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -0700` preferred when time is present.
3. Reader value baseline:
   - Avoid generic-only content.
   - Include implementation detail (code examples or concrete workflows) where relevant.
   - Target staff+ depth: include decisions, tradeoffs, constraints, failure modes, and operational rollout guidance.
4. Structure baseline:
   - Include `<!--more-->`
   - Use scannable sections (`##`, `###`), tables/checklists when useful.
   - Default depth target for technical posts: 1200+ words unless user explicitly asks for brief.
   - Include at least: one decision table, one checklist, one tradeoff section, and one failure/risk section.
5. Consistency:
   - Keep categories/tags aligned with existing repo style.
6. Specialized topic routing:
   - Backend posts should follow `.cursor/skills/backend-blog-authoring/SKILL.md`.
   - AI posts should follow `.cursor/skills/ai-blog-authoring/SKILL.md`.
7. AI freshness strictness:
   - For AI posts with fast-moving claims, require real-time verification, source links, and `Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD`.
8. Mermaid compatibility:
   - Use `{% mermaid %}` ... `{% endmermaid %}` blocks (not fenced ```mermaid) for maximum site compatibility.
   - End each Mermaid statement line with `;` to match repository render/deploy behavior.
