# Life Content Standards

For `_life` posts:

1. Front matter baseline:
   - `title`, `description`, `date`, `permalink`, `tags`
2. URL/permalink:
   - Must use `/life/.../`
3. Writing quality:
   - Provide practical takeaways, not only storytelling.
   - Use clear sections and actionable bullet points.
4. Privacy:
   - Avoid exposing sensitive personal data.
