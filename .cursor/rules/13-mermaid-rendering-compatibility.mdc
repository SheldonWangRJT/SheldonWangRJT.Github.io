# Mermaid Rendering Compatibility

For Mermaid diagrams in posts:

1. Use Liquid Mermaid blocks:
   - `{% mermaid %}` ... `{% endmermaid %}`
2. End each Mermaid statement line with `;`.
3. Validate diagram renders on local Jekyll preview before finalizing.
4. Prefer readable graph labels and avoid oversized single diagrams; split large flows.
