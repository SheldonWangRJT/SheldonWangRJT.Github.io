# AI Post Freshness Standards

Apply when topic is AI/LLM/agent/model/tooling/evaluation.

1. Freshness is mandatory:
   - run real-time verification for model capabilities, pricing, release dates, benchmarks, and product availability.
2. Source quality:
   - prefer primary sources (official docs, release notes, provider announcements, research papers).
3. Source count:
   - use at least 2 independent sources for high-impact claims.
4. Disclosure:
   - add `Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD` in volatile sections.
   - include source links near critical factual claims.
5. Uncertainty handling:
   - if facts conflict or cannot be confirmed, explicitly mark uncertainty and avoid hard claims.
