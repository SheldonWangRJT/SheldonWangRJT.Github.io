# Playground Standards

For `_playground` entries:

1. Preserve front matter in game files:
   - `title`, `date`, `permalink`
2. URL/permalink:
   - Must use `/playground/.../`
3. Technical integrity:
   - Keep asset paths compatible with Jekyll base path usage.
4. UX quality:
   - Include concise description of gameplay/features near top.
