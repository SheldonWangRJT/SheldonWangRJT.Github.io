## 💼 Question

"Tell me about a time you had too much to do and not enough time."

## 🎯 What they test

- Prioritization framework quality
- Stakeholder communication under pressure
- Ability to protect quality where it matters most

## ✅ STAR Framework

### Situation
Release date was fixed; scope was larger than available engineering capacity.

### Task
Deliver highest-impact outcomes while minimizing reliability and customer risk.

### Action

1. Ranked work by user impact x risk x reversibility  
2. Split scope into launch-critical, deferable, and post-launch  
3. Negotiated tradeoffs early with PM/design/QA  
4. Added hard quality gates for critical paths only  
5. Communicated daily burn-down and risk updates  

### Result

- Hit release window
- Protected core experience quality
- Deferred low-impact items without surprise
- Follow-up release completed remaining scope quickly

## 📌 Good interview language

"I didn’t try to save everything. I protected what was customer-critical and made explicit tradeoffs early."

## 🚫 Anti-patterns

- Heroic overtime as the only strategy
- Silent de-scoping without stakeholder alignment
- No quality boundary for critical paths

## ✅ Final takeaway

Great prioritization is not doing more tasks; it is making better tradeoff decisions with clear communication.
