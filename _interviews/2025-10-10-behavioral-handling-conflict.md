## üíº Question: "Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a teammate"

**Common variants:**
- "Describe a disagreement you had with a coworker"
- "How do you handle technical disagreements?"
- "Tell me about a time you had to work with a difficult person"

**What they're really asking:**
- Can you handle conflict professionally?
- Do you collaborate well with others?
- Are you defensive or open to feedback?
- How do you resolve disagreements?

## üéØ STAR Method Framework

Use **STAR** to structure your answer:

- **S**ituation: Set the context
- **T**ask: What needed to be done?
- **A**ction: What did YOU do?
- **R**esult: What was the outcome?

## ‚úÖ Example Answer (From My Snap Experience)

### **Situation**

"During the Matcha architecture refactor at Snap - a multi-quarter project involving 200,000 lines of code across 10 engineers - I had a significant technical disagreement with another senior engineer on my team.

We were deciding on the dependency injection pattern for 100+ libraries. I advocated for a constructor injection approach, while he strongly preferred property injection. This was a critical decision that would affect the entire codebase and couldn't easily be changed later."

### **Task**

"As the tech lead for the project, I needed to make a decision that:
- Wouldn't alienate my teammate
- Was technically sound for our scale
- Could be explained to and supported by the broader team
- Wouldn't block our timeline"

### **Action**

"Instead of pushing my solution, I suggested we:

**1. Document both approaches** - We each wrote up pros/cons with code examples

**2. Set evaluation criteria** - We agreed on what mattered:
   - Testability
   - Compile-time safety
   - Migration complexity
   - Team learning curve

**3. Build prototypes** - We spent one sprint implementing both approaches in a sample library

**4. Get broader input** - We presented both to the team and collected feedback

**5. Data-driven decision** - We looked at what similar companies used (Instagram used constructor injection at their scale)

After this process, we discovered his approach actually had merit for our dynamically-loaded libraries, while mine worked better for core dependencies. So we **used both** - constructor injection for core services, property injection for feature modules."

### **Result**

"This collaborative approach led to a better solution than either of us proposed initially. More importantly:

- ‚úÖ My teammate felt heard and became a champion of the final design
- ‚úÖ The team bought in because they participated in the decision
- ‚úÖ We documented clear guidelines for when to use each pattern
- ‚úÖ The architecture review board approved it unanimously
- ‚úÖ Six months later, the pattern was adopted by other teams

**The refactor shipped on time, won the Technical Excellence Award, and I was promoted to company-level architect.**

Looking back, the 'conflict' was actually one of the best things that happened to the project - it forced us to think more deeply and arrive at a more nuanced, better solution."

## üí° Why This Answer Works

### **What Interviewers Like:**

‚úÖ **Specific Details** - Real project (Matcha), real numbers (200K lines, 10 engineers)

‚úÖ **Collaborative Approach** - Didn't just override, sought input

‚úÖ **Data-Driven** - Used prototypes and criteria, not just opinions

‚úÖ **Win-Win Outcome** - Found a hybrid solution that used best of both

‚úÖ **Business Impact** - Project shipped, won award, got promoted

‚úÖ **Growth Mindset** - Framed conflict as opportunity to improve

‚úÖ **Leadership** - Showed how to make decisions as a tech lead

### **Red Flags to Avoid:**

‚ùå "I was right and they were wrong"

‚ùå "We just went with my approach because I'm more senior"

‚ùå "We never resolved it and the project suffered"

‚ùå "I went to the manager to decide"

‚ùå Blaming the other person or being defensive

## üéØ Template for Your Own Answer

Use this structure:

### **1. Situation (30 seconds)**
- Set context: project, team, stakes
- Introduce the conflict naturally
- Make it technical, not personal

### **2. Task (15 seconds)**
- What needed to be resolved?
- Why did it matter?

### **3. Action (60 seconds) - MOST IMPORTANT**
- What YOU specifically did (use "I")
- Show collaboration and respect
- Demonstrate problem-solving approach
- Explain your reasoning

### **4. Result (30 seconds)**
- Concrete outcomes
- Quantify if possible
- Show mutual benefit
- End positively

**Total: ~2-3 minutes**

2. **Show respect** - Never badmouth the other person
3. **Be specific** - Real project, real details
4. **Focus on YOUR actions** - What YOU did to resolve it
5. **End with results** - Concrete outcomes, quantified if possible
6. **Show growth** - What you learned

*üí° **Pro Tip:** Have 3-4 conflict stories ready covering different types (technical, process, interpersonal). Interviewers often ask follow-up: "Tell me about a DIFFERENT time..."*
