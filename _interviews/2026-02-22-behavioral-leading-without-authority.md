## 💼 Question

"Tell me about a time you led a project without being the direct manager."

## 🎯 What interviewers evaluate

- Influence style (command vs alignment)
- Ability to align priorities across teams
- Execution under ambiguous ownership
- Measurable business/engineering impact

## ✅ STAR Answer Template

### Situation
Cross-team initiative was blocked because iOS, backend, and QA had conflicting priorities.

### Task
As senior IC, you needed alignment, delivery plan, and risk visibility without formal authority.

### Action

1. Mapped stakeholders and clarified incentives  
2. Proposed shared success metric and weekly decision cadence  
3. Broke work into owner-tagged milestones  
4. Escalated only unresolved tradeoffs, not every disagreement  

### Result

- Delivered milestone on schedule
- Reduced cross-team blocker age
- Established repeatable operating rhythm used by later projects

## 💡 Why this works

- Shows influence through structure and clarity
- Demonstrates leadership as system design, not title
- Emphasizes outcomes over personal heroics

## 🚫 Common mistakes

- "I convinced everyone because I was right"
- vague situation with no measurable result
- conflict-heavy narrative with little collaboration evidence
