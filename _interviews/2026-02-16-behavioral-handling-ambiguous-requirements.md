## 💼 Question

"Describe a project where requirements were unclear. How did you proceed?"

## 🎯 Interview intent

- Can you move forward without perfect specs?
- Do you reduce ambiguity systematically?
- Can you protect timeline while managing risk?

## ✅ STAR Structure

### Situation
Product goal was clear, but requirements changed weekly and multiple stakeholders disagreed.

### Task
Deliver usable v1 without waiting for full certainty.

### Action

- Created assumption log (explicit, reviewable, dated)
- Proposed phased scope (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Added decision checkpoints every 1-2 weeks
- Built thin vertical slice to validate critical unknowns early

### Result

- Shipped v1 on time
- Fewer late rework cycles
- Stakeholders trusted process due to transparent assumption tracking

## 🧠 Strong phrasing

"I optimized for reversible decisions early, and delayed irreversible decisions until signal quality improved."

## 🚫 Weak phrasing

"I just made a guess and hoped it worked."

## ✅ Closing line

Frame ambiguity as an execution problem solved by structure, communication, and risk sequencing.
