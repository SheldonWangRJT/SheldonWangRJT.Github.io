# Repository Agent Guidance

This repository uses project-local Cursor guidance for content workflows.

## Primary Policy

- For blog/content requests, follow `.cursor/rules/` and `.cursor/skills/blog-authoring/SKILL.md`.
- Use `.cursor/guidance/blog-publishing-guide.md` as the canonical publishing guide.

## Scope

- These rules are repository-specific and must not be treated as global user guidance.
- For technical posts, prefer practical implementation detail over generic explanations.
